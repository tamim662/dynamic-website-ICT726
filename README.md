# MindGlow â€“ Dynamic Web Application

## About MindGlow
MindGlow is a dynamic PHPâ€“MySQL web application designed to provide therapy resources, self-help tools, and a supportive environment for users.  

The project began as a **static website** and has been transformed into a **full-stack web application** with user authentication, database integration, and admin moderation. Its primary aim is to demonstrate how accessible, standards-compliant, and secure web applications can be built with open-source technologies.
